Wien's displacement law

Formally, Wien's displacement law states that the spectral radiance of black-body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the wavelength λpeak given by:

where T is the absolute temperature. b is a constant of proportionality called Wien's displacement constant, equal to 2.897771955...×10−3 m⋅K,[1] or b ≈ 2898 μm⋅K.
